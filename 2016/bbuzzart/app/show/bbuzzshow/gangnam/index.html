                                            Girlish and sentimental remark about the surrounding world is the key feature defining the nature of my painting. It is not making a muscular statement of physically changing the world, but exploring order and patterns that can be seen in it. I depict banal objects, trivial events, and memories of acquainting people. The pettiness is isolated from its surrounding context and enlarged, highlighting its existence. Usage of color proposes a subliminal communication that is not so affirmative and happy, but produces an awkward positive. In a glance my works may seem to portray the naïve lightness and the kitsch of pop art. However, taking a second look, my works reflect intimate dialogue and warm perspective towards life.

                                            I´m Paloma Marquez, from Argentina, I was born in 1988 and I grew up in a small town called Chilecito.<br/>
                                            I´m a visual and new media artist, my work involves paintings, videos and installations with technology. I show my work in several cultural places as galleries and embassies in Argentina and in USA.<br/>
                                            Nowadays I´m working in a new serie, mixing hipperrealistic objects as luggages, boots, doors, containers, etc with tiny little mens that have to deal with it in different ways. This objects where selected specifically because they carry and save information or another objects, for example the boots... carry all the stories and situations that they had to witness, even though they are useless in a corner... they still have all that information in its shape and skin. As the boots... I think of other objects, I paint them as an honour to them.<br/>
                                            I also have this little people that present a dialogue with a mass of people or with the objects, this people are presented in black or white in different situations. I usually work with acrylic on canvas, but I also work with sound and video or installations, always with the same theme.

                                            Most of my works are portraits. Every person is a protagonist of his or her own tragic story.<br/>
                                            The Bar series became the starting point of a lager series of work. Two years ago, I worked at a bar and had to defenselessly face man-anyone from their 20s to 60s - and they are the ones depicted in this series. They included a wide variety of people, such as salaried workers, doctors, shops owners. All of them talked about themselves and complained that they were absolutely unhappy. I had to listen to all kinds of stories. Some were very private, while others made me choke just listening to them. As it went on, I felt as if I were being inundated by their explosive rage and grief. It was like they were ghost and would stay in one corner of the bar with the same slovenly faces even when they went back to work the next day. Even though they had no personalities, they were all similar faces tangled within my mind-and they never left. One day i started to draw them on a memo pad given to me by a daily installment loaner, and the drawings led to paintings. I hated, pitied, and identified with them. I had no choice but to pay attention to them and I've constantly painted people like them since then. These were people going through very ordinary, daily misfortunes. As humans, we need to embrace the ceaseless misfortunes we've experienced in our lives and will also face in the future.  Each of us has an absolute and universal tragedy. I find this kind of tragedy in my life and other people, and then collect and gather to paint their portraits.
